# sandbox
My playground for using new methods. Used to test new methods I learn.

At the moment, I am experimenting with [XML](https://soccerJoshNumberNine.github.io/sandbox/hobbies.html) and [JSON](https://soccerJoshNumberNine.github.io/sandbox/games.html). Please visit this [important page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ 'License') before using __*any*__ of the stuff you see in this repo.

```js
function whyIsThisHere () {
  return 'As a test.';
}

alert(whyIsThisHere);
```
